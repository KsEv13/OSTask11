Output of the Program 1:
Hello
Hello
Output of the Program 2:
Hello


In the first program, the line is printed to the buffer, but since there 
is no new line, the current line is simply stored in it. Then the 
program executes the fork, and both forked buffers are flushed when the 
corresponding processes exit.
In the second case, the buffer causes to be flushed before the fork, so 
that there is no output left when the forked process exits.
